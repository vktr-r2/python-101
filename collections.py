"""
COLLECTIONS NOTES

- Provide a way to store multiple values in a single variable
- Items in collection are called elements.  Can be variables or literal valuables
- Collections can be nested, an element can be a collection
- Come with built in additional functionality

Different Types: Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Ranges

"""


"""
LISTS

- Store 0 or more items at specific indexes
- Can access elements based on their index
- Cannot access items at indexes that don't exist, there is no array bounds auto-checks
- Can contian multiple types of variables in Python.  This makes Python flexible, but also slower than other more strict languages
- Mutable (modifyable)


"""


"""
TUPLES

- Very similar to lists
- Access elements based on index
- Can contain multiple types of variables
- IMMUTABLE (cannot modify once declared)


"""



"""
DICTIONARIES

- Store key-value pairs at each index
- Each element is a tuple of a key-value pair
- Access values based on key, not index
- Can also retrieve just a list of keys or just a list of values
- MUTABLE


"""


"""
RANGES

- Represent lists of consecutive whole numbers but odn't have functionality of lists
- Used for loops
- Have to specify start and end values
- Can also specify step value
- Can wrap in reversed() function to count backwards
