FUNCTIONS NOTES

- Contain blocks of code to be executed exactly when we choose to call the function
- Code remains dormant until we run the function
- Reusable => write function once, use it as many times as you need
- Can receive inputs (paramaters) and produce outputs (return statements)



PARAMETERS

- Inputs into a function
- Parameter is name for placeholder variable, argumenet is the actual value that is input
- Functions can have 0 or more parameters
- We use these parameters as variables within the function code



RETURN VALUES

- Outputs from a function
- Not necissary to specify return type
- Specified by a return statement within the function
- Once return statement is reached, function stops executing and outputs the value (or no value if no return value was given)
- Return statements are optional.  If there is no return statement in a function, function just exits after the last statement is executed
- Can store the output as a variable when calling the function
