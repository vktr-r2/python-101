""" OPERATORS
- enable us to perform operations on vars
- few modify a var value, most do not
- can be strung together, always follow order of operations left to right.  Best practice to use brackets to break up chains of operators for readability


ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
- Generally used for numberical calculations
- Can be used to glue strings together (concat)
- Produce new numerical or string result, usually leaving original numbers untouched

+ => addition
- => subtraction
* => multiplication
/ => division
% => modulus => returns remainder of a division
// => floor division => preforms division and discards remainder
** => exponentiation

ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
- Used to assign values to vars
- Can be used in combination with arithmetic operators
- =

+=
-=
*=
/=
%=

COMPARISON OPERATORS
- Used to compare two values
- Variables can be numerical, string, or booleans

LOGICAL OPERATORS
- Used to test additional conditions
- Typically used on booleans and control flow
