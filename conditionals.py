CONDITIONALS NOTES

- Conditionals are also known as control flow
- Allow us to choose which parts of the code to execute based on outcome of certain tests
- Tests typically compare variables, or test single variable
- Return true or false.
- Can nest if statments to add subsequent tests
- Can add multiple testing conditions in an if statement with or/and operators to test multiple conditions at once
"""



"""
IF STATEMENTS

- Execute some statements IF a test evaluates to true
- Do nothing if test evaluates to false
"""



"""
ELIF STATEMENTS

- Short for else if
- Allows you to chain extra if statement tests to allow for more outocmes
- Only executed if previous test(s) fail
- Come after if statement
"""



"""
ELSE STATEMENTS

- Provides a catch-all or failsafe
- Only executed if previuous test(s) fail
- Can only come after if or elif statement
- Doesn't actually test anything, just executes code
