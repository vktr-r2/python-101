"""
LOOPS NOTES

- Loops are another form of control flow, just like conditionals
- Provide a way to automate code to run multiple times
- Statements are places within the loop and they are executed continuously until some break condition is met
- Can put what ever we want in the loop body, but all code will be executed with each iteration of the loop
"""




"""
WHILE LOOPS

- While loops function similar to if statements but run the code continuously rather than just once
- Code breaks out of a while loop once the test condition evaluates to false
- MUST set a test condition, otherwise loop will run infinitely
- Very useful for when we don't know exactly how many times a loop should run
"""



"""
FOR LOOPS

- Often referred to as for-in loops in Python
- Run a set number of times with specific start and end points
- Very useful if you need to visit every element in some range or list, starting at the beginning and finishing at the end
